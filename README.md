These libraries are intended to reduce the amount of code you have to write, freeing code reading and writing
time, so you can focus more on what you want to build for your users (even if you're the only one), or
have more time to have `fun`.

1. toast 用法
     toast("hello")
     
2. onClick 用法
 
    button.onClick {
           // todo
        }
        

3. 启动activity 
     start<DemoActivity>
    
    
    
    
    
   您可以直接导入generalextensionlibrary ，或者拷贝其中文件到您的项目快速开发，
 希望能帮到您！
